# Clock Divider Project with Testbench

Welcome to my Clock Divider Project repository! This project is designed to demonstrate the implementation of a clock divider using Verilog, accompanied by a comprehensive testbench for verification. Ideal for students, educators, and professionals interested in digital design and verification using SystemVerilog and Verilog.

## Project Overview

The clock divider is a fundamental component in digital electronics, used to reduce the frequency of a clock signal. This project provides a practical example of creating a scalable clock divider and includes a testbench for validating its functionality across different division factors.

## Features

- **Clock Divider Module**: A Verilog module that divides an input clock signal by predetermined factors.
- **Testbench**: Accompanying the clock divider module is a testbench designed to verify the functionality of the clock divider under various scenarios, ensuring its reliability and performance.
- **Scalable Design**: The design is made to be easily adjustable to different division factors, catering to various use cases and applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need a Verilog simulation tool such as ModelSim, Icarus Verilog, or any environment that supports Verilog/SystemVerilog.

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with digital logic and Verilog/SystemVerilog.
- A Verilog simulation tool (e.g., ModelSim, Icarus Verilog).

### Running the Simulation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open your Verilog simulation tool.
3. Compile the `clock_divider.v` and `clock_divider_tb.v` files.
4. Run the simulation and observe the waveform to verify the clock division operation.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the clock divider or its testbench are welcome. Whether it's a bug fix, a new feature, or an improvement to the documentation, please feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
